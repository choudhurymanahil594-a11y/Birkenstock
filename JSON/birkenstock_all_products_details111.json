        "description": "The BIRKENSTOCK London is a variation on the classic Boston shoe. The raised heel section is characteristic of this simple low shoe with no stitching. It boasts a natural, rustic look and an open-selvage, unlined finish. Its natural design is also down to the upper made from especially soft suede, which hugs the foot like a second skin. Anatomically shaped footbed Upper: suede Footbed lining: suede Sole: EVA Details: individually adjustable metal pin buckle “Made in Portugal” Suede is a split leather with a napped finish. It has a velvety surface and is very soft to the touch. It also boasts a high moisture absorption capacity. Suede is softer and more flexible by nature and does not have the same stability as smooth leather. The stability of suede also varies from hide to hide. This does not constitute a material or production defect.",

        "description": "The BIRKENSTOCK Lutry is a slipper that can be worn as a backstrap style or as an open clog thanks to the flexible ankle strap. The footbed can be removed so that you can choose between three different footbed versions. This basic version of this design features our Standard Footbed. It replicates the natural print made by a foot walking on sand and will see you through the day in comfort. Its natural design is down to the upper made from especially soft suede, which hugs the foot like a second skin. Removable, anatomically shaped cork-latex footbed Upper: suede; nubuck leather Footbed lining: suede Sole: natural rubber with cork elements Details: clog with a flexible ankle strap and individually adjustable metal pin buckle Footbed “Made in Germany” Standard Replacement Footbed Zermatt / Andermatt Shearling Replacement Footbed Zermatt / Andermatt Suede is a split leather with a napped finish. It has a velvety surface and is very soft to the touch. It also boasts a high moisture absorption capacity. Suede is softer and more flexible by nature and does not have the same stability as smooth leather. The stability of suede also varies from hide to hide. This does not constitute a material or production defect.",

        "description": "With the Tokio Super Grip, BIRKENSTOCK developed a clog for occupations that demand a great deal of stamina from the wearers and their feet. Its Super Grip sole results in the ideal rolling motion and is nonslip. A midsole made from EVA cushions every step. The special rubber tread delivers tangible sure-footedness. This stability is further enhanced by the adjustable backstrap. This is something that’s appreciated by those working in the medical professions and in kitchens and by service staff, all of whom often spend hours on their feet. The sole of the Tokio Super Grip has been tested for slip resistance in accordance with EN ISO 20347:2012. Anatomically shaped cork-latex footbed Upper: smooth leather Footbed lining: suede Sole: cushioning EVA midsole with nonslip, oil- and grease-resistant rubber outsole Details: individually adjustable metal pin buckles Slip resistance tested in accordance with EN ISO 20347:2012 (SRA category) The natural leather that we use is mostly smooth leather, in some cases tumbled leather. This type of leather has many special characteristics, such as breathability, adaptation to the shape of the foot and durability.",

The classic is now available in a particularly cozy premium design. Its natural design is down to the upper made from especially soft suede, which hugs the foot like a second skin. Our model (f) wears the narrow width. Our model (m) wears the regular width. Suede is a split leather with a napped finish. It has a velvety surface and is very soft to the touch. It also boasts a high moisture absorption capacity. Suede is softer and more flexible by nature and does not have the same stability as smooth leather. The stability of suede also varies from hide to hide. This does not constitute a material or production defect.",

Its enclosed design and the nonslip treaded sole offer reliable grip and maximum sure-footedness in kitchens and the food industry. Its solid steel toe cap protects toes and the front of the foot from impacts of up to 200 joules. Its oil- and grease-resistant material is also water-resistant, allowing it to be cleaned efficiently and thoroughly. This involves removing the cork-latex footbed and washing the clog at up to 80° Celsius. Both parts of the shoe are suitable for daily disinfection. The anatomically shaped original BIRKENSTOCK footbed protects joints and tendons, and is also washable at up to 30° Celsius. The footbed is available separately and can therefore be replaced if necessary. The A 640 model is certified in accordance with EN ISO 20345:2011 SB E (SRC category).

The soft heel tab not only guarantees comfort but also ensures that the shoe is easy to put on and take off. The comfortable and light Deep Blue Footbed makes the shoe a perfect 24/7 all-rounder. Its natural design is down to the upper made from especially soft suede, which hugs the foot like a second skin.

This does not constitute a material or production defect.",

It has a velvety surface and is very soft to the touch. It also boasts a high moisture absorption capacity. Suede is softer and more flexible by nature and does not have the same stability as smooth leather. The stability of suede also varies from hide to hide.

The Boston has a legendary status thanks to its sophisticated, individually adjustable design. The upper is made from soft, embossed suede. Anatomically shaped cork-latex footbed Upper: embossed suede Footbed lining: suede Sole: EVA Details: one strap with an individually adjustable metal pin buckle Made in Germany Suede is a split leather with a napped finish. It has a velvety surface and is very soft to the touch. It also boasts a high moisture absorption capacity. Suede is softer and more flexible by nature and does not have the same stability as smooth leather. The stability of suede also varies from hide to hide. This does not constitute a material or production defect.",

The QS500 is presented as a simple, modern sneaker with 6-hole lacing. This ESD version was developed specifically for people working in microelectronics or with high-frequency technology. ESD stands for “electrostatic discharge\". These shoe models continuously discharge their wearers gently. The antistatic elements in the sole balance out potential differences between the electrical charge of the wearer and their work environment by permanently “grounding\" the feet and can be identified by a round, yellow emblem. Warning: the ESD range goes up to values of 35 Mohm and is therefore non-insulating! The nonslip, metal-free, and oil- and petrol-resistant outsole additionally provides for energy absorption around the heel and is penetration-resistant. A 200-joule steel toe with a scratch-resistant toe cap protects the forefoot. The upper is made from water-resistant smooth leather (WRU) and offers antistatic protection.

The Adventure Crosstown is a sporty version of this model. It is designed with all adventurous and active BIRKENSTOCK fans in mind.

Anatomically shaped cork-latex footbed Upper: oiled nubuck leather Footbed lining: suede Sole: polyurethane (PU) Details: two straps, each with an adjustable metal pin buckle; two-component sole “Made in Germany” Oiled leather is one of our favourite types of leather. Its oily waxed surface makes for a unique colour effect and develops a beautiful patina.

Anatomically shaped cork-latex footbed Upper: suede Footbed lining: shearling Sole: EVA Details: two straps, each with an adjustable metal pin buckle “Made in Germany” Suede is a split leather with a napped finish. It has a velvety surface and is very soft to the touch. It also boasts a high moisture absorption capacity. Suede is softer and more flexible by nature and does not have the same stability as smooth leather. The stability of suede also varies from hide to hide. This does not constitute a material or production defect.",

        "description": "The BIRKENSTOCK Medina is a variation on the classic Gizeh. The thong sandal has two straps that merge with one another to give it a sturdy look and function. This version revives the traditions of leather goods manufacturers with its look. This is possible thanks to the surface texture of the high-quality, soft aniline leather. With its two components, the sole guarantees stability and comfort. It comprises a cushioning midsole made from EVA and an outsole made from genuine rubber. The upper is made from high-quality, soft natural leather. Anatomically shaped cork-latex footbed Upper: aniline leather Footbed lining: suede Sole: rubber-EVA sole Details: thong and strap with an individually adjustable metal pin buckle Made in Germany The natural leather that we use is mostly smooth leather, in some cases tumbled leather. This type of leather has many special characteristics, such as breathability, adaptation to the shape of the foot and durability.",
